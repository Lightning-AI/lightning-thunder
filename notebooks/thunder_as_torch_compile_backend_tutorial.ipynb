    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with PyTorch2.0, the `torch.compile` feature introduces a powerful way to optimize and accelerate the PyTorch models. As its core, `torch.compile` relies on the following key components:\n",
    "1. TorchDynamo - A Python-level tracing tool that transforms Python function calls into an intermediate representation(IR)\n",
    "2. Backends - Systems that further process the IR, optimizing and executing the computational graph for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "While PyTorch provides several built-in backends such as \"inductor\" and \"cudagraphs\", it also supports custom backends that allow users to define their own optimization strategies. Thunder as a deep learning compiler can either be used on its own to accelerate model performance (see the [Thunder overview](https://lightning-thunder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic/overview.html) and other tutorials for more details) or also integrate with `torch.compile` as a backend. This is possible because TorchDynamo transforms the original Python code into new, optimized Python code that represents the same computation, which Thunder can directly process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on `torch.compile`, we recommend reading PyTorch documentation and tutorials:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction to torch.compile - [Link](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_compile_tutorial.html)\n",

    "##### How `ThunderCompiler` Handles FX Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ThunderCompiler` serves as the backend for torch.compile, processing the FX graph generated by TorchDynamo. If the graph contains regions unsupported by Thunder, ThunderCompiler splits the FX graph into smaller subgraphs. To achieve this, it leverages the [split module pass](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/fx/passes/split_module.py) provided by `torch.fx` to customize the rules of how to split the FX graph. `ThunderCompiler` implements its own [callback function](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning-thunder/blob/75ba590708178bfe61b7ec2ed2d579d9edb7daa9/thunder/dynamo/splitter.py#L101-L135) to:\n",
    "1. Split the FX graph into supported subgraph that is compiled and executed by Thunder\n",
    "2. Send unsupported subgraphs to alternative execution path -- PyTorch’s Inductor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common causes for graph splitting include:\n",
    "1. Unsupported operators: when encounter operators that are not supported by Thunder\n",
    "2. Compilation Errors: when exceptions occur while attempting to compile operators using Thunder. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can inspect the split reasons and review how the FX graph was split by accessing the `TorchCompiler.subgraph_infos` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that ThunderCompiler accepts `thunder.jit` options as keyword arguments to customize the compilation of subgraphs executed by Thunder. Similarly, `torch_inductor_options` options can be specified for subgraphs executed by Inductor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `sinc` operator is not yet supported by Thunder. As a result, the original FX graph is split into three parts. The first and third part is executed by Thunder. The second part contains the unsupported `sinc` operator and is executed by Inductor."
