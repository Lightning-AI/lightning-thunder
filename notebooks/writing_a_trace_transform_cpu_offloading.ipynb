    "#### Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand transforms, we need to know what a `Trace` is. In `thunder`, `Trace` is the representation of the jitted program in terms of thunder operations/symbol. Each operation in `Trace` is a collection of `BoundSymbol` i.e. a `Symbol` with it's input and output. We can also print the trace as a Python program for easier inspection. We will do this later in the notebook. To understand these concepts, you can read the helpful `zero_to_thunder.ipynb`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`thunder` allows us to write our custom transforms to transform trace/s. These transforms can be used for replace pointwise operations with fused implementation, compute gradient of the given computation, etc. Besides this, `thunder` enables us to apply these transforms at different stages during compilation. In this tutorial, we will use the post optimization stage, the point at which we already have the forward and the backward execution trace ready. To write our transform, we have to inherit from `Transform` class. This class implements the interface that each transform should have. By default, it provides no-op transformations. To use our transform, we provide an instance of our transform object to the `thunder.jit` via `transforms` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before writing our transform, we will make an `OperatorExecutor` with which we will create 2 operators/symbol - 1. to offload tensors to CPU 2. Load the offloaded tensors back to CUDA device. You read more about adding custom operators in `adding_custom_operator.ipynb` and also `zero_to_thunder.ipynb`."

The `return` symbol of the forward trace has a sequence of tensors which are saved for the backward trace. We go through this list of tensor and find all the intermediate tensors (i.e. which are not an input to the trace). Here, we will also call a user provided callback which can further filter this list of tensors to offload.\n",
    "2. In the forward trace, we then find the last of use of the tensors to offload from above step and insert a call to `offload_to_cpu` symbol that we created above. Note that we will also save a map of which tensors we offloaded. We also note the original device where the tensor lived so that we can load it back to correct device.\n",
    "3. In the forward trace, we then update the `return` symbol to return the offloaded tensors (which are saved for the backward pass).\n",
    "4. In the backward trace, we read from the map of the tensors which were offloaded and update the `unpack` symbol of saved tensors to replace the original tensors with our offloaded tensors.\n",
    "5. In the backward trace, we then find the first use of the offloaded tensor in a computation and insert a `load_to_gpu` call before it. Note that here, we will use the previously stored map of tensor to original device so that we load it onto the correct device.\n",
