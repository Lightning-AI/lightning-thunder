    "\n",
    "In recent times, the LLM models have grown so large that all the model parameters don't fit on a single GPU. To circumvent this problem, there are various strategies like Tensor Parallel, Pipeline Parallel, Fully Sharded Data Parallel, etc to train these large models. In this tutorial, we discuss and implement Zero2 strategy for Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP).\n"

    "#### What is Zero2 strategy for FSDP?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this strategy, we shard the model parameters across all the availabe GPUs. That is each GPU holds onto only a chunk of the parameter. During the forward pass, all GPUs call `all_gather` communication primitive to gather the parameters from other GPUs. Unlike Zero3 strategy which frees the parameter after forward pass, we save these unsharded parameters for backward pass. This is to save the overhead of extra communication. In the backward pass, we utilize the saved parameters and compute the gradients. Once the gradients are computed, we use `reduce_scatter` communication primitive to reduce (average) the gradients across all GPUs and scatter those gradients so that a given GPU holds only a chunk of gradient.\n",

This takes care of reducing the gradients across all the GPUs and sharding them. One thing to note, for averaging gradients with low dynamic range dtype like `float16`, if we naively sum the gradients across GPUs before dividing by `world_size`, it can lead to overflows. So we scale the gradient tensor with `world_size`, before calling `reduce_scatter` with `sum` reduction to effectively average the gradients without overflow."
