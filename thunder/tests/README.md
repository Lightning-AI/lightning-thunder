Testing is important!

Most Thunder operators are tested by automatically generated tests that use data from the operator's "OpInfo", defined
in `opinfos.py`. These tests typically compare Thunder's operator behavior with another framework, using the
"sample inputs" defined by its OpInfo. Each OpInfo should define a sample input generator and “reference” implementation in PyTorch (and in the future, NumPy).

When an operator is very similar across the three language levels (user, core, and primitive), like cos, only one variation is typically tested (the core language variant is preferred).
However, there are also cases where testing a torch language operation or primitive operation directly makes sense.

Operator tests are autogenerated in `test_ops.py`. To run the tests for a particular operator, use pytest’s -k option.
For example, to run the tests for `cos`, for example, the command would be

```bash
pytest test_ops.py -k cos -v
```

This will run tests for Thunder’s different executors, supported dtypes, and supported devicetypes.

The OpInfo tests can also be run from Python, and this can be extremely useful for debugging.
To do that, find the generated test name you’d like to run (often by invoking the tests from the command line and observing their names) and call it. Here’s a sample program:

```py
import traceback
import thunder.tests.test_ops as to

e, exc_info, snippet, opinfo, devicetype, dtype, args, kwargs = to.test_core_vs_torch_consistency_cos_nvFuser_CUDA_float32()

traceback.print_exception(*exc_info)
```

If the test fails, it will return information about the failure, including error information and the arguments that caused the failure.
In the above sample the traceback information is printed. If the test succeeds then it will return nothing.

It can be a little tricky to remember all the components a test returns, but you can
always catch and print the return value to better understand what's available.
